        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Cewu Lu</b>, Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Distinguished Professor of the Changjiang
            Scholars Program (长江学者特聘教授), and recipient of the Scientific Exploration Award. In 2016, he was selected as
            a high-level overseas young talent, and in 2018, he was named one of the 35 Innovators Under 35 in China by
            MIT Technology Review (MIT TR35). In 2019, he received the Qiushi Outstanding Young Scholar Award,
            and in
            2020, he was the third contributor to the Shanghai Science and Technology Progress Special Award. In 2022,
            he received the Ministry of Education Youth Science Award and was recognized for one of the six best papers
            at IROS (out of 3579 submissions). In 2023, he was nominated for the Best
            System Paper Award at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference (one of four nominations) and
            received the Scientific Exploration Award (the only recipient in the field of embodied intelligence).
            <br><br>
            Before he joined SJTU, he was a research fellow at Stanford University working under Prof. Fei-Fei Li and
            Prof. Leonidas J. Guibas. He was a Research Assistant Professor at Hong Kong University of Science and
            Technology with Prof. Chi Keung Tang. He got the his PhD degree from The Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong,
            supervised by Prof. Jiaya Jia.
            <br><br>
            As a corresponding author or first author, he has published more than 100 papers in high-impact journals and
            conferences, including <b>Nature</b>, <b>Nature Machine Intelligence</b>, and TPAMI. He serves as a reviewer
            for Science,
            Nature sub-journals, Cell sub-journals, and as area chair for NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IROS, and ICRA. His
            research interests include embodied intelligence and computer vision.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The development of <b>Robots for general-purpose</b> has long been a shared dream of humanity, as their
            realization
            would significantly enhance productivity—by, for instance, performing tasks typically undertaken by nurses
            or cleaning staff—and improve the quality of life through applications such as domestic service robots. A
            general-purpose robot must be capable of executing a wide range of tasks in diverse and open-ended
            environments, posing a formidable challenge in the field of artificial intelligence. The crux of this
            challenge lies in enabling robots to acquire human behavioral capabilities.

            Building upon a strong foundation in the visual understanding of human behavior, we aim to explore a novel
            approach: empowering robots to learn comprehensive, general-purpose behaviors by observing and interpreting
            vast amounts of human activity in video form. Compared to the mainstream
            approach of guiding robotic behavior through large language models, our strategy offers several advantages
            in achieving generalizability:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Autonomous Learning:</b> Human behavior videos capture the full scope of tasks and their various
                possibilities, circumventing the limitations of manually defined tasks.</li><br>
            <li><b>Scalability:</b> The extensive accumulation of videos through the growth of the internet covers
                nearly
                every conceivable human task and operation.</li><br>
            <li><b>Automatic Expansion:</b> With large volumes of new videos uploaded daily, robots can automatically
                extend
                their capabilities to include new tasks and skills.</li>
        </ul>

        By implementing this innovative approach, we pave the way for a more universally applicable and effective
        solution to the challenge of creating general-purpose robots.
